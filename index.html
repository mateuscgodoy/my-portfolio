            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I was born in a small town in Brazil, where I lived almost my entire life until I went on to earn a
                degree in
                Food Engineering and while it's a
                wonderful field, I realized that it wasn't for me. It wasn't until
                two years ago
                that I had my first encounter with programming, but since then, I have been fully invested in it.
                Learning to code has
                been a transformative experience for me, and it's opened up a whole new world of possibilities.</p>
            <p>I started my programming journey with C# and quickly became fascinated by game development. I spent
                countless hours
                studying and experimenting with Unity, and it was an incredibly rewarding experience. However, after
                nearly two years, I
                began to feel like I wanted to explore other possibilities. That's when I discovered the world of web
                development, and I
                knew I had found my calling. I've been diving deep into this fascinating field ever since, and I'm
                constantly amazed by
                all the amazing things that can be done with C# and the web.</p>
